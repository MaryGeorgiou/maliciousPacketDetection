# Malicious packet detection
Deep neural network models for malicious packet detection.
In this work we introduce a network intrusion detection approach (NIDS) for network conncetion records, which is based on deep learning methods for natural language processing (NLP).

For training and testing we use the [KDD99](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) and [KDD-NSL](http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html) datasets.
